                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    New Years Resolutions are made by people every year and while some stick to them, others do not. We thought it would be interesting
                    to visualize the types of resolutions that were made in 2015 heading into 2016. The aim of this project is for us to visualise data
                    with about 3 to 4 dimensions. We wanted to enable users have an overview of all the data points in the data set and identify patterns.
                    Our second aim was for the user to be able to interact with the data to get answers to their visual queries. They should be able to
                    drill down to lower levels of dimensionality and interact with the discreet data. To achieve these aims we used an interactive
                    visualisation software called <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a>, which is a javascript visualisation library.
                </p>
                <h3><a name="data"></a> Our Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We got the data off a <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/blog/new-years-resolutions-2015">CrowdFlower</a> blog about new year
                    resolutions. The data was scrapped off of Twitter, taking anything that was tweeted from the United States with a 'hashtag' of #NewYearsResolution.
                    The data that they collected was compiled into a csv file with the following columns: Twitter handle, gender, tweet, resolution category, resolution
                    topic (which narrows down the category), 'retweet' count, tweet time and date, location coordinates and state.

                <h2> Research</h2>
                <p>
					Before the initial design was developed, research into existing visualizations on the same topic was done. All the visualizations discovered
                    were static and the data was not multi-dimensional. Below are some of the visualizations along with an analysis for each of them.
                </p>
                <div id="NJ">
                    <h3> Example 1: New Jersey New Year's Resolution</h3>
                    <div class="chart_exp2">
                        <p>
                            The <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/what_tops_njs_new_years_resolution_list.html"> visualization </a> associated a different colour with
                            each category in the pie chart. This made it easy to get the know which categories were most popular. Though pie charts are considered  bad
                            visualizations(especially for multiple categories), this one shows the value(percentage) for category each clearly. This helps especially when looking
                            at the poorer performing categories. Without this extra information, it would difficult to tell which slice of the pie chart is smaller than the other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no discrete information displayed. Therefore so one does not know how big the data set they was used is or if the data was a true representation of
                            the new year's resolutions of the people in New Jersey. Lastly, one cannot drill down on the data to see specific numbers about the categories.

                            The second visualization uses a horizontal bar chart to represent the data. Vertical bar graphs are more intuitive than horizontal ones.
                            The graph (seen better <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/378105/new-years-resolution/">here</a>) uses percentages
                            but the sum of the values is not 100.  and we are not certain why.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The total of each category was shown next to its bar which makes it easy to know the actual value and make a comparison.
                            The graph could have used a different color to represent each category or resolution to make easier to distinct between the categories.
                            The downside to this is that the graph has 21 resolutions and it might not be easy to get 21 distinct colours that will not be affected by the background.

                            Given that our <a href="#data"> data </a> had a location for each data point, this visualisation was the closest to what we had in
                            mind. The map shows the 50 states and the most popular category in each state. The use of colour and a symbol to represent
                            a category makes it easier to have visual queries answered. The symbols are easy to understand and a key as seen
                            <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/73426/most-popular-new-years-resolutions-each-state">here</a> was provided.

                            However, no other comparisons can be made such as how other categories performed in a state besides the "winner". Another issue
                            with this visualization is that the states are not labelled and therefore one had to know names and location of states to fully
                            understand the visualization.

                        The main bar graph appears to be a stacked line graph. It takes a while to realize that not the entire area from the x-axis up to
                        the line is taken into account and only the area that is the specific category's colour is considered. For example one might think that the blue category
                        (smoking) was the best performing yet it is actually the worst performing. Furthermore, the use of a pie chart makes difficult to differentiate between the size of
                        the smoking and alcohol categories. The slider at the bottom of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024280/visualized/visualizing-the-new-years-resolutions-were-all-trying-not-to-break"> this visualization</a>
                        is a useful feature as it allows users to change the time range and see how the data changes with time.

                        The colours are distinct enough but with a grey background, the <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151229005116/en/%E2%80%98Enjoying-Life-Fullest%E2%80%99-2016%E2%80%99s-Top-Years-Resolution">visualization</a>
                        could have used the 6 colours in the unique hue for humans. The different saturation of blue and red could mislead a user into thinking that different quantities of the
                        same thing are being represented. Another misleading feature is the different sizes of the circles. Size is used to make objects stand out and therefore it is misleading here
                        because it shows the size of a state and could someone using this visualization. The full name of each state is not shown which makes it harder to understand the
                        visualization if one is not familiar with the map of USA. However, it is very easy to understand the 'indicates a tie' feature and more information about the
                        visualization including graphs is provided <a href="http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/enjoying-life-2016s-top-new-years-resolution-survey/"> here</a>.

                <ul class="list">

                <h2> Design Iterations</h2>
                <h3> Initial Design</h3>
                <div class="map">
                    <img src="initialMap.PNG" border="1">
                    <p> Figure 6 : The initial design as presented to the class </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The initial design included a map and supporting graphs (below) to show discrete information about the data. The map shows all the data
                    points in the data set at the same time and how they are the spread across the nation and in each state. Each point on the map
                    represents a tweet and the location from which it was tweeted. Users can get all the information about a data point by hovering over it
                    (shown on image above). The slider below the map allows users to select the range of time starting from the 21st of December 2015 to the
                    1st of January 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above the map, there are checkboxes with each one representing a category or a gender (male and female). This is to allow a user to
                    select any number of categories or a specific gender they wish to view. The changes made in the selection are propagated to the map
                    and graphs in order for them to show only the selected categories or gender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design caters for comparison between a maximum of two states, which can be done by selecting the two states from the two combo
                    boxes above the map. Selecting one state would highlight the state (and grey out everything else) on the map and change the graphs to
                    represent only that state. Selecting another state would then highlight both the states and display both the graphs of the states to allow
                    for comparison between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, the choice of colours was made with a white background in mind. All the colours of the unique hue were selected with the
                    exception of white and yellow. Because a white background was being used, these 2 colours could not be chosen as they would not be clearly
                    visible. Therefore the colour yellow was replaced with orange and white with grey.

                <h3> Second Iteration </h3>
                <p>
                    The second iteration was developed using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a>. The visualization
                    is interactive and contains all the data points.

                <h5> Use shape as well as colour to represent a category</h5>
                <p>
                    We thought the colors representing the categories were so distinct that a person did not need an additional symbol to help them
                    easily identify a category. Due to the fact that we have a large data set we decided not to use symbols for categories because we
                    felt they would only overcrowd the map even more. We decided use a circle to represent data points and have them colour coded to the
                    category it falls under. An extra dimension of gender was added by having male data points have a black border around the circle,
                    while female data points have a white border.
                </p>
                <h5> Comparing two states</h5>
                <p>
                    Users have the ability to compare only two states at a time. A state is chosen by selecting it from the combo box above the map. This
                    changes the map as well as the graphs, therefore providing discrete information. Comparisons can be made within a single state across
                    its different categories or genders. Comparisons can also be made between two states across all of their categories or in one specific
                    category.
                </p>
                <h5> Use both texture and colour for bar graphs </h5>
                <p>
                    The graphs use both colour and texture. Each category retains its colour while texture is added to the bar representing females as clearly
                    shown on the key.
                </p>
                <h5> Have a bit more of theme - resolutions - add appeal to your graphic </h5>
                <p>
                    Rather than adding the new year's theme to our visualisation through symbols and colour etc., we decided to add the theme to the
                    web page instead. We wanted a visually appealing visualisation that did not overwhelm the user with unnecessary symbols and colour.
                    Our aim is for the user to easily understand the visualization and have their visual queries answered as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h5> Total resolution (category) "winner" of the state shown as a texture?</h5>
                <p>
                    At this stage had not added this feature because one category was the winner in about 47 of the 50 states. We thought this would
                    just fill up the entire map with the symbol or color and decided to think about it for final implementation. A smaller map would be
                    added next to the large map showing this. This map would look like the one showed below. We decided to make a decision on this during
                    the final implementation.
                </p>

                    <p> Figure 11: A map showing the 'winning' category in each state</p>

                    Symbols were discarded for this iteration because they were only going to be used on the key and therefore served no major purpose. The slider
                    showing time ranges was discarded because of the short time frame it covered. This iteration is interactive and users get more information by
                    interacting with the visualization in different ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Hovering over a data point on the map shows all the information about that point. </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a state in the combo box. This removes all the data points on the rest of map and only leaves the ones in that specific state.
                        The graphs change accordingly. This could be improved by greying out the other points instead of removing them completely so that a user
                        still has an overview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a second state would show the data points in this state, change the graphs and therefore enable users to make comparisons
                        between the two states. This iteration caters for comparisons between only 2 states.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a gender selects or un-selects the gender depending on its current state(selected or un-selected). This adds or removes the
                        data points (for that gender) on the map and changes the graphs as well. Selecting categories works exactly like selecting the gender.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Feedback after presentation of 2nd iteration</h4>
                <p> The feedback from the presentation of the second iteration was quite similar to the feedback from the 1st presentation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Add a symbol for each category</li>
                    <li> The white border around the "female" data points was not visible to some people</li>
                    <li> Enlarge a state when a user selects it</li>
                    <li> Use a 2 different shapes - one for males and one for females</li>
                    <li> Add a frame around the map</li>
                    <li> Add more appeal (theme) to the visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Final Implementation </h3>
                <h4> Changes from the second iteration to the final visualization</h4>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the 2nd presentation, we decided to make changes to the visualization based on the feedback above.
                </p>
                <h4> Other Design Decisions</h4>

                <p>
                    The final implementation is very similar to our initial design. This was expected as we did not get a lot of negative feedback after
                    our first presentation. With this visualization, we are able to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Show all the information about each tweet and its location on the map</li>
                    <li> View all the information for only one state or category or gender</li>
                    <li> Compare any two states</li>
                    <li> Compare any number of categories at the same time</li>
                    <li> Compare the two genders by each category and or state</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Strengths </h3>
                <p>
                    The visualization has an overview (map) of all the data in the data set and has graphs which show discrete information. The graphs
                    make it easy to comparisons from the visualization. Furthermore, the visualization covered the 3 main categories discussed by Ben
                    Shneiderman in his visualization mantra. These are Overview, Zoom and Filter and lastly, Details on Demand. The map provided the
                    overview while the interactivity of the visualisation provided the other 2.
                </p>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>
                    The map overview (before any interaction) allows a user to see all the data points at the same time. From this, the user can notice
                    patterns or see which categories are popular in which areas.
                </p>
                <h4>Zoom and Filter:</h4>
                <p>
                    Users can zoom into a particular state to see the information for only the selected state. The graphs change to show discrete
                    information, such as number of resolutions in each category, for that particular state. Using the same functionality, users can make
                    comparisons between two states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filtering can be done on both the categories and the genders. This allows users to see information about a specific category in a
                    specific state or on the entire map. Filtering also changes the graphs to enable users get more information about the category or
                    gender they have selected.
                </p>
                <h4>Details on demand:</h4>
                <p>
                    Clicking on a point on the map shows all the information about that particular data point on the map. This allows a user to get all the information
                    about that tweet while having an overview of the entire data set in the background.
                </p>
                <h3> Weaknesses </h3>
                <p>
                    The major weakness of our visualization is the poor spacing. The East of the map has significantly more data points. There is nothing
                    we could about this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, most of the queries require the user to interact with the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The states are not labelled which makes it hard for people who are not familiar with the map of USA to know the location of each state or
                    which state they are looking at without selecting one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no "all" and "nothing" buttons or checkboxes. The "all" button would enable a user select all the categories at once without having to check all the
                    9 checkboxes. And similarly, the "nothing" button would enable a de-select all the catgories and choose the one they want to explore.
                </p>
                <h3> Difficulties </h3>
                <h3> Conclusions </h3>
                <h3> Future work</h3>
                <p>
                    Future work could include finding a way to add the name of each state to the map.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We could also include the slider. This would enable user look at less data without selecting a gender, category or state. Other users could
                    make conclusions based on when a resolution was made.

                    The group worked together and used the <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> application for communication and file sharing. Google drive was
                    also used to share files as well work collaboratively. All the members agreed on the final design before implementation. Lastly, we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/"> Github </a> and this enabled us to see the changes each one of us was making without necessarily having to meet. The
                    work was divided among the 3 members in the following way:
                </p>
                <table cellpadding="10%">
                    <thead align="left">
                    <tr>
                        <th style="color: #00004d">Name</th>
                        <th style="color: #00004d">Work done</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr style="background-color: rgba(24, 0, 128, 0.2)">
                        <td>Michael Kyeyune</td>
                        <td>Implementation of the map and coordinates</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Thandile Xiphu</td>
                        <td>Implementation of the graphs</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="background-color: rgba(24, 0, 128, 0.2)">
                        <td>William Lumala</td>
                        <td>Editing HTML code and web page layout</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The system was very efficient and enabled us to work on all the tasks concurrently.
