                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Year in, year out, one of the traditions that is yet to go the way of the dinosaurs is that of making new year resolutions. People of all walks of life,
                    at just about the stroke of midnight on 31st December (every year),  take a moment to reflect on the year that has been and what they plan to do for the
                    one that is to come ... well the sober ones (if you don't recall then you know where you fall). The list of resolutions is endless, we presume, involving topics
                    such as health, self improvement and getting to meet Scarlett Johansson.
                    With such a vast array of possibilities, we got curious as to what
                    other people besides ourselves resolve to achieve in the new year. As such we set out to obtain new year resolutions data, categorise it and carry out an analysis to
                    get an insight into the most popular resolutions, the resolutions split according to gender and regions where to certain resolutions fared better than others. Given that the
                    internet has an answer to everything, we found data on New Year Resolution tweets
                    which formed the basis of our visualisation. We hoped to develop a visualisation that anybody inquisitive about different new year resolutions and how they compare with regards to topic would find
                    helpful.

                <h3><a name="data"></a> Our Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The data utilised for the visualisation was a dataset of tweets about new year resolutions obtained from <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/" target="_blank">CrowdFlower</a>, a platform
                    for data scientists to enrich their data. Each record in the dataset had a twitter handle, the gender of the person who made the tweet, the tweet content, the category of new year resolution that the tweet content fell in,
                    the date the tweet was made, the retweet count, the state and the location coordinates of the person who made the tweet at that time. The locations provided for all the tweets were all from the United States of
                    America. The dataset itself can be downloaded <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h2> Research</h2>
                <p>
                    It is said that you should not reinvent the wheel, a saying so true to itself that no one has bothered thinking up another way to give the same message. In this regard, we set out to find visualisations that had
                    attempted to show the same kind of data with similar dimensions. This research set the foundation upon which our visualisation was built.

                    <h3> Example 1: New Jersey New Year's Resolution</h3>
                    <div class="chart_exp2">
                        <p>
                            The first example we have is a pie chart visualisation depicting new years resolutions made by people in the state of New Jersey. The <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/what_tops_njs_new_years_resolution_list.html"> visualization </a> associated a different colour with
                            each category in the pie chart. This made knowing which categories were most popular easy for a viewer. Though pie charts are considered poor means of
                            visualization(especially for multiple categories), this one shows the value(percentage) for each category clearly. This helps especially when looking
                            at the poorer performing categories. Without this extra information, it would difficult to tell which slice of the pie chart is smaller than the other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no discrete information displayed. Therefore, one does not know how big the data set they was used is or if the data was a true representation of
                            the new year's resolutions of the people in New Jersey. Lastly, one cannot drill down on the data to see specific numbers about the categories.

                        <p>
                            The second visualization uses a horizontal bar chart to represent the data. Vertical bar graphs are more intuitive than horizontal ones.
                            The graph (seen better <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/378105/new-years-resolution/">here</a>) uses percentages
                            but the sum of the values is not 100.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The total of each category was shown next to its bar which makes it easy to know the actual value and make a comparison.
                            The graph could have used a different color to represent each category or resolution to make easier to distinct between the categories.
                            The downside to this is that the graph has 21 resolutions and it might not be easy to get 21 distinct colours that will not be affected by the background.

                            Given that our <a href="#data"> data </a> had a location for each data point, this visualisation was the closest to what we had in
                            mind. The map shows the 50 states and the most popular category in each state. The use of colour and a symbol to represent
                            a category makes it easier to answer visual queries. The symbols are easy to understand and a key as seen
                            <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/73426/most-popular-new-years-resolutions-each-state">here</a> was provided.

                        <p>
                            However, no other comparisons can be made such as how other categories performed in a state besides the "winner". Another issue
                            with this visualization is that the states are not labelled and therefore one had to know names and location of states to fully
                            understand the visualization.

                    <p>
                        The main bar graph appears to be a stacked line graph. It takes a while to realize that not the entire area from the x-axis up to
                        the line is taken into account and only the area that is the specific category's colour is considered. For example one might think that the blue category
                        (smoking) was the best performing, yet it is actually the worst performing. Furthermore, the use of a pie chart makes it difficult to differentiate between the size of
                        the smoking and alcohol categories. The slider at the bottom of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024280/visualized/visualizing-the-new-years-resolutions-were-all-trying-not-to-break"> this visualization</a>
                        is a useful feature as it allows users to change the time range and see how the data changes with time.

                        The colours are distinct enough but with a grey background, the <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151229005116/en/%E2%80%98Enjoying-Life-Fullest%E2%80%99-2016%E2%80%99s-Top-Years-Resolution">visualization</a>
                        could have used the 6 colours that are unique hues for humans. The different saturation of blue and red could mislead a user into thinking that different quantities of the
                        same thing are being represented. Another misleading feature is the different sizes of the circles. Size is used to make objects stand out and therefore it is misleading here
                        because it shows the size of a state and could confuse someone using the visualisation. The full name of each state is not shown which makes it harder to understand the
                        visualization if one is not familiar with the map of USA. However, it is very easy to understand the 'indicates a tie' feature. This is because those particular circles are
                        depicted with more than one colour. More information about the visualization including graphs is provided <a href="http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/enjoying-life-2016s-top-new-years-resolution-survey/"> here</a>.

                <h2> Design Iterations</h2>
                <h3> Initial Design</h3>
                <div class="map">
                    <img src="initialMap.PNG" border="1">
                    <p> Figure 6 : The initial design as presented to the class </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the initial visualisation was to fully utilise all the dimensions available from the the data i.e category, gender, time,
                    state, coordinates, and tweet data. This was satisfied through a combination of checkboxes, radio buttons, drop down boxes, slider and map
                    shown in the figure 6, 7 and 8, the first paper mockup of our visualisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each checkbox at the top of the map represented a category, with each category represented by different colours to aid in the clarification of
                    different data points across the map and in the graph. At this point, the choice of colours was made with a white background in mind. All the colours
                    with a unique hue were selected with the exception of white and yellow. These two colours could not be used as they would not be clearly visible on a
                    white background. Therefore, the colour yellow was replaced with orange and white with grey. On selection of a particular category, the map and graphs
                    were meant to change accordingly to show only data from the chosen categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The genders were represented by radio buttons in the same vein as the checkboxes. In that selecting a particular gender would accordingly adjust the
                    map to show points of only that selection and graphs to show data of only that particular gender. The dropdown boxes also provided the option to select
                    data for a particular state and if two states are chosen, show comparisons between their data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integration of the time dimension was done through the slider at the bottom of the map in figure 6. Through it, a user could select a date range from
                    anywhere starting 21st December to 1st January and only tweet data within that range is shown both within the map and graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enable the user to get both details on demand as well as an idea of the distribution of the different resolutions across the country, data points
                    representing the different tweets at their respective coordinates were added to the map. Hovering over a particular data point would pop up a tooltip that
                    gave the data of the particular tweet i.e tweet handle, tweet content and gender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graphs to be utilised were of a simple nature; figure 7 gave the breakdown of male and female count depending on the selections of the topics whilst
                    figure 8 provided a the breakdown of the different topics in a bar graph. Each topic bar was coloured the same as the checkbox to maintain cohesion with the
                    checkboxes. In figure 7, texture was also used to distinguish between the two bar graphs. This was because the unique colours that could stand out were already
                    utilised in the figure 8.

                <p>
                    The aim of the second iteration of the visualisation was to bring to life the initial paper mock up through interactivity
                    and address the criticisms brought up about the initial mock up. <a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a>, a JavaScript library for generating visualisations
                    was utilised to include interactivity in the prototype. Figure 9 below shows the map on implementation and figure 10 shows the graph.

                    In this iteration, the dimension of time was removed from the visualisation. It was found that though each tweet differed when it came to time of day,
                    all the tweets with the exception of a few took place on 31st December and as such the time range functionality could not be sufficiently used.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To provide a visual distinction between male and female data points on the map, the male data points were given a black boundary whilst the female data points were given a white boundary.
                </p>

                <h4> Implementation of feedback (from 1st presentation) in 2nd iteration</h4>

                <h5> Use shape as well as colour to represent a category</h5>
                <p>
                    Shapes were not used in this implementation. We were of the mind that the colours were sufficient to distinguish between categories. There was also worry that introducing shapes that were not
                    shown anywhere else in either the map or graphs besides the legends of those two respective entities would be misleading. A user could look around the map expecting to find data points of a required
                    category with the provided shape only to not find it.
                </p>
                <h5> Comparing two states</h5>
                <p>
                    In the visualisation, states can be picked for comparison. In this scenario, the picked states are highlighted in the map and only their data is shown within it. The graph as well changes to show
                    comparison of the two states data.
                </p>
                <h5> Use both texture and colour for bar graphs </h5>
                <p>
                    The graphs use both colour and texture. Each category retains its colour while texture is added to the bar representing females as clearly
                    shown in figure 10.
                </p>
                <h5> Have a bit more of theme - resolutions - add appeal to your graphic </h5>
                <p>
                    Rather than adding the new year's theme to our visualisation through symbols and colour etc., we decided to add the theme to the
                    visualisation web page instead. We wanted a visually appealing theme that did not overwhelm the user with unnecessary symbols and colour.
                </p>
                <h5> Total resolution (category) "winner" of the state shown as a texture?</h5>
                <p>
                    This was not implemented. Analysis of the data found that only two categories stood out with one taking over 47 of the states and the other the remaining
                    4 states. This would have led to a map as shown in figure 11 which we found lacking in visual appeal.
                </p>
                <div class="winner">
                    <img src="winnerinstate.PNG" border="1">
                    <p> Figure 11: A map showing the 'winning' category in each state</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Symbols were discarded for this iteration because they were only going to be used on the key and therefore served no major purpose. The slider
                    showing time ranges was discarded because of the short time frame it covered. This iteration is interactive and users get more information by
                    interacting with the visualization in different ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Hovering over a data point on the map shows all the information about that point. </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a state in the combo box. This removes all the data points on the rest of map and only leaves the ones in that specific state.
                        The graphs change accordingly. This could be improved by greying out the other points instead of removing them completely so that a user
                        still has an overview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a second state would show the data points in this state, change the graphs and therefore enable users to make comparisons
                        between the two states. This iteration caters for comparisons between only 2 states.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on a gender selects or deselects the gender depending on its current state(selected or deselected). This adds or removes the
                        data points (for that gender) on the map and changes the graphs as well. Selecting categories works exactly like selecting the gender.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4> Feedback after presentation of 2nd iteration</h4>
                <p> The feedback from the presentation of the second iteration was quite similar to the feedback from the 1st presentation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Add a symbol for each category</li>
                    <li> The white border around the "female" data points was not visible to some people</li>
                    <li> Enlarge a state when a user selects it</li>
                    <li> Use two different shapes - one for males and one for females</li>
                    <li> Add a frame around the map</li>
                    <li> Add more appeal (theme) to the visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Final Implementation </h3>
                <h4> Changes from the second iteration to the final visualization</h4>
                <p>
                    The second iteration visualisation was adjusted to fulfill the requirements set by the feedback and as such in the final implementation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Symbols were added to the keys of the map and graphs</li>
                    <li>The gender data points were distinguished according to shape; circles for male and squares for female</li>
                    <li>Zooming capability added to map and activated on clicking on state then zooming out on clicking on that very same state</li>
                    <li>Frame added to map and graph</li>
                    <li>Theme added to the visualisation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The final implementation can be navigated to by clicking the Visualisation tab on the left or clicking <a href="implementation.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="discussions">
                <h2> Discussion </h2>
                <p>
                    The final implementation is very similar to our initial design. This was expected as we did not get a lot of negative feedback after
                    our first presentation. With this visualization, we are able to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Show all the information about each tweet and its location on the map</li>
                    <li> View all the information for only one state or category or gender</li>
                    <li> Compare any two states</li>
                    <li> Compare any number of categories at the same time</li>
                    <li> Compare the two genders by each category and or state</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Strengths </h3>
                <p>
                    The visualization has an overview (map) of all the data in the data set and has graphs which show discrete information. The graphs
                    make it easy to comparisons from the visualization. Furthermore, the visualization covered the three main categories discussed by Ben
                    Shneiderman in his visualization mantra. These are Overview, Zoom and Filter and lastly, Details on Demand. The map provided the
                    overview while the interactivity of the visualisation provided the other two.
                </p>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>
                    The map overview (before any interaction) allows a user to see all the data points at the same time. From this, the user can notice
                    patterns or see which categories are popular in which areas.
                </p>
                <h4>Zoom and Filter:</h4>
                <p>
                    Users can zoom into a particular state to see the information for only the selected state. The graphs change to show discrete
                    information, such as number of resolutions in each category, for that particular state. Using the same functionality, users can make
                    comparisons between two states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filtering can be done on both the categories and the genders. This allows users to see information about a specific category in a
                    specific state or on the entire map. Filtering also changes the graphs to enable users get more information about the category or
                    gender they have selected.
                </p>
                <h4>Details on demand:</h4>
                <p>
                    Clicking on a point on the map shows all the information about that particular data point on the map. This allows a user to get all the information
                    about that tweet while having an overview of the entire data set in the background.
                </p>
                <h3> Weaknesses </h3>
                <p>
                    The major weakness of our visualization is the poor spacing. The East of the map has significantly more data points. There is nothing
                    we could about this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, most of the queries require the user to interact with the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The states are not labelled which makes it hard for people who are not familiar with the map of USA to know the location of each state or
                    which state they are looking at without selecting one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no "all" and "nothing" buttons or checkboxes. The "all" button would enable a user select all the categories at once without having to check all the
                    nine checkboxes. And similarly, the "nothing" button would enable a deselect all the categories and choose the one they want to explore.
                </p>
                <h3> Difficulties </h3>
                <p>
                    During the implementation, we found it hard to add tooltips to the different states on the map. If added, these tooltips collided with those for the different data points.
                    Given that states cover an area unlike data points that are at specific positions, the tooltips of the states would get in the way as the map was hovered over. As such, a user
                    would have to know which state is which when picking one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We failed to find a visually appealing way to show gender breakdown per category when a comparing two states. At the moment this can only be done through the tooltip above
                    a particular bar graph for a category which gives a breakdown for the females and males for that category for that state.
                </p>
                <h3> Conclusions </h3>
                <p>We as a team found that having multiple design iterations for our visualisation helped us refine our design. The suggestion we struggled with the most was incorporating a theme
                to make the visualisation more appealing. We started with a rough idea of what we wanted to achieve and
                through the iterations and feedback received from the presentations we were able to create a visualisation that was allows a viewer to
                easily answer the visual queries we identified.</p>
                <h3> Future work</h3>
                <p>
                    Future work could include finding a way to add the name of each state to the map. Finding a less cluttered way to represent the data is something that could also be worked on.
                    A heat map could be used, where the intensity represents a high number of resolutions being made. This would be at the cost of losing out on the granularity of the data. This
                    view could then be used to supplement the current map with individual data points that we currently have.

                    The group worked together and used the <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> application for communication and file sharing. Google drive was
                    also used to share files as well work collaboratively. All the members agreed on the final design before implementation. Lastly, we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"> Github </a> and this enabled us to see the changes each one of us was making without necessarily having to meet. The
                    work was divided among the 3 members in the following way:

                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr style="background-color: rgba(24, 0, 128, 0.2)">

                        <td>Implementation of the map and coordinates and report</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Thandile Xiphu</td>
                        <td>Implementation of the graphs and report</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="background-color: rgba(24, 0, 128, 0.2)">

                        <td>Report and editing HTML code and web page layout</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The system was very efficient and enabled us to work on all the tasks concurrently.
