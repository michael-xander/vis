                <p>
                    New Years Resolutions are made by people every year, while some stick to them and others do not, we thought it would be interesting to visualise the types of resolutions that were made in 2015 heading into 2016.

                <h2> Research</h2>
                <p>
                    Before developing our initial design, we searched for existing visualizations that had been done on New Years resolutions. We found quite a few examples, however, we thought that they all could be inproved in some way or another, but there were a few lessons to be taken away from each of them which we then incorporated into our own design.Below are some critiques of the designs we found.
                </p>
               
                <div id="NJ">
                 <h3> Example 1: New Jersey New Year's Resolution</h3>
                    <div class="chart_exp2">
                        <p>
                            This visualization associated different colours with each category in the pie chart, which made it easy to get a gist of which categories of resolutions were most popular. We did not like the use of a pie chart and thought that a bar graph would be better suited to represent the data, because once you start looking at the poorer performing categories it is difficult to tell which slice of the pie chart is smaller than the other. Lastly, there was no discrete information, so one does not know how big the data set they was used is or if the data was a true representation of the new year's resolutions of the people in New Jersey. One also can not drill down on the data to see specific numbers about the categories.

                <p>
                    The second visualization uses a horizontal bar chart to represent the data. We thought that vertical bar graphs are more intuitive than horizontal. The graph uses percentages which may not be evident from looking at the graph as it gives no indication that the values represent persentages.The summation of the values is 99, we are not sure why they do not add up to 100. The graph
                    could have used more colour to help distinguish between the categories. The total of each category was shown next to its bar which makes it easy
                    to know the actual value and make a comparison.

                <h3> Example 3: New Year's Resolutions by state 2016</h3>
                <p>
                    This visualisation was the closest to what we had in mind. The map shows the 50 states and the most popular category in each state. We like the use of
                    colour and a symbol to represent a category. The symbols were easy to understand and a key (not shown here) was provided. However, we
                    could not make any other comparisons such as how other categories performed in a state besides the "winner". Another issue we had with this
                    visualization is that the states were not labelled and therefore one had to know names and location of states to fully understand the visualization.

                <p>
                    The main bar graph appears to be a stacked line graph. It is not easy to understand what the visualization is showing because it takes a while to realise that not the entire area from the x-axis up to the line is taken into account, only the area that is the specific category's colour is considered, for example one might mistakingly think that the blue category, smoking, was the best performing but it is actually the worst performing. Furthermore,
                    we did not like the use of a pie chart because it is difficult to differentiate between the size of the smoking and alcohol categories. The slider at the bottom is a nice addition as it allows users to change the time range and see how the data changes with time.

                    The data that we used we got off a <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/blog/new-years-resolutions-2015">CrowdFlower</a> blog about new year resolutions. The data was scrapped off of Twitter, taking anything that was Tweeted from the United States with a hastag of NewYearsResolution. The data that they collected was compiled into a csv file with the following columns: Twitter handle, gender, tweet, resolution category, resolution topic (which narrows down the category), retweet count, tweet time and date, location coordinates and state.

                <h2> Initial Design</h2>

                <p><img src="initialMap.PNG" border="1"></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The initial design included a map and supporting graphs (below) to show discrete information about the data. We used a map in order
                    to show all the data points in the data set at the same time and to show the spread across the nation and individual states. Each point on the map represents a tweet
                    and the location from which it was tweeted. Users can get all the information about a data point by hovering over it (shown on image
                    above). We included the slider below the map allows so that users can select the range of time starting from the 21st of December 2015 to the 1st of January 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above the map there are checkboxes, with each one representing a category or a gender (male and female). This is to allow a user to select any number of categories they wish to view. The changes made in the selection are propagated to the map and graphs in order for them to show only the selected categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our design caters for comparison between a maximum of two states, which can be done by selecting the two states from the two combo boxes above the
                    map. Selecting one state would highlight the state on the map and change the graphs to represent only that state. Selecting another state
                    would then highlight both the states and display both the graphs of the states to allow for comparison between the two.

                <h3> Implementation of feedback and redesign </h3>
                <p> After the presentation of our initial design where we received feedback from Michelle and other students, we thought about how each of the points mentioned above would affect our final visualization and made a few changes based on the feedback.
                </p>
                <h4> Use shape as well as colour to represent a category</h4>
                <p> We thought the colors representing the categories were distinct enough that a person did not need an additional symbol to help them easily identify a category. Due to the fact that we have a large dataset we decided not to use symbols for categories because we felt they would only contribute to over crowding the map. We decided to have circles to represent data points and have them colour coded to the category it falls and and we added an extra dimension of gender by having male data points have a black outline, while female data points had a white outline.
                </p>
                <h4> Compare two states</h4>
                <p>
                    Users have the ability to compare two states at a time. A state is selected by selecting it from the combo
                    box above the map. This changes the map as well as the graphs, therefore providing discrete information. Comparisons can be made within a single state across its different categories or genders and comparisons can also be made between two states across all of their catergories or in one specific category.
                </p>
                <h4> Use both texture and colour for bar graphs </h4>
                <p>When comparing genders or two states texture, in the form of lines as can be seen in the bar graph depicting the new year's resolutions by gender, is used to differentiate between the two. We decided against using texture for the categories because the colour we felt was enough to help the user effectively differentiate between the categories.
                </p>
                <h4> Have a bit more of theme - resolutions - add appeal to your graphic </h4>
                Rather than adding the new year's theme to our visualisation through symbols and colour etc. we decided to add the theme to the website instead. We wanted a visually appealing visualisation that did not overwhelm the user with unnecessary symbols amd colour. Our aim is for the user to easily get a gist of the data while still having a  ************************
                </p>
                <h4> Total resolution (category) "winner" of the state shown as a texture?</h4>

                <p>
                    The final implementation is very similar to our initial design. This was expected as we did not get a lot of negative feedback after
                    our first presentation.<br>
                    With this visualization, we are able to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Show all the information about each tweet and its location on the map</li>
                    <li> View all the information for only one state or category</li>
                    <li> Compare any two states</li>
                    <li> Compare any number of categories at the same time</li>
                    <li> Compare the two genders by each category and state</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Strengths </h3>
                <p>
                    The visualization is interactive and enables users to choose what information they would like to view at a particular time. Furthermore,
                    the visualization covered the four main categories discussed by Ben Shneiderman. These are Overview, Zoom and Filter and lastly, Details on Demand.
                    The map provided the overview while the interactivity of the visualisation provided the other three.
                </p>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>
                    The map overview (before any interaction) allows a user to see all the data points at the same time. From this, the user can notice
                    patterns or see which categories are popular in which areas.
                </p>
                <h4>Zoom and Filter:</h4>
                <p>
                    Users can zoom into a particular state and will be able to view that information better. The graphs will also show discrete information
                    about that particular state. Using the same functionality, comparisons can be made between 2 states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filtering can be done on both the categories and the genders. This allows users to see information about a specific category in a
                    specific state or on the entire map. Filtering also changes the graphs to enable users get more information about the category or
                    gender they have selected.
                </p>
                <h4>Details on demand:</h4>
                <p>
                    Clicking on a point on the map shows all the information about that data point on the map. This allows a user to get all the information
                    about that tweet while having an overview in the background.
                </p>
