                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    New Years Resolutions are made by people every year, while some stick to them and others do not, we thought it would be interesting to visualise
                    the types of resolutions that were made in 2015 heading into 2016. The aim of this project is for us to visualise as much high dimensional data
                    as we can in such a way that a user will be able to look at the visualisation and draw conclusions just from the overview of the data that has
                    been provided. Our second aim was for the user to be able to interact with the data that they are exploring. They should be able to drill down
                    to lower levels of dimensionality and interact with the discreet data. To achieve these aims we used an interactive visualisation software
                    called <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a>, which is a javascript visualisation library.
                </p>
                <h3><a name="data"></a> Our Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The data that we used we got off a <a href="http://www.crowdflower.com/blog/new-years-resolutions-2015">CrowdFlower</a> blog about new year
                    resolutions. The data was scrapped off of Twitter, taking anything that was tweeted from the United States with a hashtag of #NewYearsResolution.
                    The data that they collected was compiled into a csv file with the following columns: Twitter handle, gender, tweet, resolution category,
                    resolution topic (which narrows down the category), 'retweet' count, tweet time and date, location coordinates and state.

                <h2> Research</h2>
                <p>
					Before developing our initial design, we searched for existing visualizations that had been done on New Years resolutions. We found quite a
                    few examples, however, we thought that they all could be improved in some way or another, but there were a few lessons to be taken away from
                    each of them which we then incorporated into our own design. Below are some critiques of the designs we found.

                    <h3> Example 1: New Jersey New Year's Resolution</h3>

                        <p>
                            This visualization associated different colours with each category in the pie chart, which made it easy to get a gist of which
                            categories of resolutions were most popular. We did not like the use of a pie chart and thought that a bar graph would be better
                            suited to represent the data, because once you start looking at the poorer performing categories it is difficult to tell which slice
                            of the pie chart is smaller than the other. Lastly, there was no discrete information, so one does not know how big the data set they
                            was used is or if the data was a true representation of the new year's resolutions of the people in New Jersey. One also can not drill
                            down on the data to see specific numbers about the categories.

                            The second visualization uses a horizontal bar chart to represent the data. We think that vertical bar graphs are more intuitive than
                            horizontal ones. The graph uses percentages which may not be evident from looking at the graph as it gives no indication that the values
                            represent percentages.The summation of the values is 99, we are not sure why they do not add up to 100. The <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/378105/new-years-resolution/">
                            graph</a> could have used more colour to help distinguish between the categories. The total of each category was shown next to its bar
                            which makes it easy to know the actual value and make a comparison.

                            Given that our <a href="#data"> data </a> had a location for each data point, this visualisation was the closest to what we had in
                            mind. The map shows the 50 states and the most popular category in each state. We like the use of colour and a symbol to represent
                            a category. The symbols were easy to understand and a key (not shown here) was provided. However, we could not make any other comparisons
                            such as how other categories performed in a state besides the "winner". Another issue we had with this visualization is that the states
                            were not labelled and therefore one had to know names and location of states to fully understand the visualization.

                    <p>
                        The main bar graph appears to be a stacked line graph. It is not easy to understand what the visualization is showing because it takes
                        a while to realise that not the entire area from the x-axis up to the line is taken into account, only the area that is the specific
                        category's colour is considered, for example one might think that the blue category, smoking, was the best performing but it is actually
                        the worst performing. Furthermore, we did not like the use of a pie chart because it is difficult to differentiate between the size of
                        the smoking and alcohol categories. The slider at the bottom of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024280/visualized/visualizing-the-new-years-resolutions-were-all-trying-not-to-break"> this visualization</a>
                        is a nice addition as it allows users to change the time range and see how the data changes with time.

                    With our visualization, we want the user to be able to answer the following questions:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li> What is the <strong> distribution </strong> of tweets per <strong> category</strong> throughout the <strong> nation </strong> or in a <strong> state</strong> ? </li>

                <h2> Design Iterations</h2>
                <h3> Initial Design</h3>
                <p><img src="initialMap.PNG" border="1"></p>
                <p>
                    The initial design included a map and supporting graphs (below) to show discrete information about the data. We used a map in order to show
                    all the data points in the data set at the same time and to show the spread across the nation and individual states. Each point on the map
                    represents a tweet and the location from which it was tweeted. Users can get all the information about a data point by hovering over it
                    (shown on image above). We included the slider below the map allows so that users can select the range of time starting from the 21st of
                    December 2015 to the 1st of January 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above the map there are checkboxes, with each one representing a category or a gender (male and female). This is to allow a user to select
                    any number of categories they wish to view. The changes made in the selection are propagated to the map and graphs in order for them to show
                    only the selected categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our design caters for comparison between a maximum of two states, which can be done by selecting the two states from the two combo boxes above
                    the map. Selecting one state would highlight the state on the map and change the graphs to represent only that state. Selecting another state
                    would then highlight both the states and display both the graphs of the states to allow for comparison between the two.

                </ul>

                <h3> Second Iteration </h3>
                <p>
                    The second iteration, seen <a href="implementation.html">here</a> was developed using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a> to enable see how
                    the all the data points fitted on the map.
                </p>
                <h4> Implementation of feedback (from 1st presentation) in 2nd iteration</h4>
                <p>
                    After the presentation of our initial design where we received feedback from Michelle and other students, we thought about how each
                    of the points mentioned above would affect our 2nd iteration and made a few changes based on the feedback.
                </p>
                <h5> Use shape as well as colour to represent a category</h5>
                <p>
                    We thought the colors representing the categories were distinct enough that a person did not need an additional symbol to help them
                    easily identify a category. Due to the fact that we have a large data set we decided not to use symbols for categories because we
                    felt they would only overcrowd the map even more. We decided use a circle to represent data points and have them colour coded tp the
                    category it falls under. We added an extra dimension of gender by having male data points have a black outline, while female data
                    points have a white outline.
                </p>
                <h5> Comparing two states</h5>
                <p>
                    Users have the ability to compare two states at a time. A state is selected by selecting it from the combo box above the map. This
                    changes the map as well as the graphs, therefore providing discrete information. Comparisons can be made within a single state across
                    its different categories or genders. Comparisons can also be made between two states across all of their categories or in one specific
                    category and of course gender.
                </p>
                <h5> Use both texture and colour for bar graphs </h5>
                <p>
                    When comparing genders or two states, texture, in the form of lines as can be seen in the bar graph depicting the new year's resolutions
                    by gender, is used to differentiate between the two. We decided against using texture for the categories because the colour we felt
                    was enough to help the user effectively differentiate between the categories.
                </p>
                <h5> Have a bit more of theme - resolutions - add appeal to your graphic </h5>
                <p>
                    Rather than adding the new year's theme to our visualisation through symbols and colour etc. we decided to add the theme to the
                    website instead. We wanted a visually appealing visualisation that did not overwhelm the user with unnecessary symbols amd colour.
                    Our aim is for the user to easily understand the visualization and have their visual queries answered as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h5> Total resolution (category) "winner" of the state shown as a texture?</h5>
                <p>
                    At this stage had not added this feature because one category was the winner in about 47 of the 50 states. We thought this would
                    just fill up the entire map with the symbol or color and decided to think about it for final implementation.
                </p>
                <h4> Feedback after presentation of 2nd iteration</h4>
                <p> The feedback from the presentation of the second iteration was quite similar to the feedback from the 1st presentation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Add a symbol for each category</li>
                    <li> The white border around the "female" data points was not visible to some people</li>
                    <li> Enlarge a state when a user selects it</li>
                    <li> Use a 2 different shapes - one for males and one for females</li>
                    <li> Add a frame around the map</li>
                    <li> Add more appeal (theme) to the visualization</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Final Implementation </h3>
                <h4> Changes from the second iteration to the final visualization</h4>
                <p>
                    After the 2nd presentation, we decided to make changes to the visualization based on the feedback above.
                </p>
                <h5> Different shapes for the 2 genders </h5>
                <h5> Symbols for the categories </h5>
                <h4> Other Design Decisions</h4>

                <p>
                    The final implementation is very similar to our initial design. This was expected as we did not get a lot of negative feedback after our first presentation.
                    With this visualization, we are able to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Show all the information about each tweet and its location on the map</li>
                    <li> View all the information for only one state or category or gender</li>
                    <li> Compare any two states</li>
                    <li> Compare any number of categories at the same time</li>
                    <li> Compare the two genders by each category and or state</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Strengths </h3>
                <p>
                    The visualization has an overview (map) of all the data in the data set and has graphs which show discrete information. The graphs make it easy to
                    comparisons from the visualization. Furthermore, the visualization covered the 3 main categories discussed by Ben Shneiderman in his visualization mantra.
                    These are Overview, Zoom and Filter and lastly, Details on Demand. The map provided the overview while the interactivity of the visualisation provided the other 2.

                    The map overview (before any interaction) allows a user to see all the data points at the same time. From this, the user can notice
                    patterns or see which categories are popular in which areas.
                </p>
                <h4>Zoom and Filter:</h4>
                <p>
                    Users can zoom into a particular state to see the information for only the selected state. The graphs change to show discrete information, such as number of resolutions in each category, for that particular state. Using the same functionality, users can make comparisons between two states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filtering can be done on both the categories and the genders. This allows users to see information about a specific category in a
                    specific state or on the entire map. Filtering also changes the graphs to enable users get more information about the category or
                    gender they have selected.
                </p>
                <h4>Details on demand:</h4>
                <p>
                    Clicking on a point on the map shows all the information about that particular data point on the map. This allows a user to get all the information
                    about that tweet while having an overview of the entire data set in the background.

                <h3> Weaknesses </h3>
                <p>
                    The major weakness of our visualization is the poor spacing.The East of the map has significantly more data points. There is nothing we could
                    about this as the data was
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another weakness is that most of the queries require the user to interact with the visualization ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The states are not labelled which makes it hard for people who are not familiar with the map to know which state is located where.
                </p>

                    The group worked together and used the <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> application for communication and file sharing. Google drive was
                    also used to share files as well work collaboratively. All the members agreed on the final design before implementation. Lastly, we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/"> Github </a> and this enabled us to see the changes each one of us was making without necessarily having to meet. The
                    work was divided among the 3 members in the following way:
